# End goal
A tool to simulate animals interacting with each other and their environment over multiple generations and observe evolution through natural selection.

# Features/Requirements

## Creatures
- Easy to add new creatures programmatically
- Different genes/properties for each creature
    - Ex: speed, size, color, vision, hunger, thirst, energy, etc
- Mutations in genes when reproducing

## Environment
- Includes: map, food, water, obstacles, etc
- Map is easily customizable programmatically
    - Stretch goal: allow users to create maps through GUI

## Simulation
- Speed control
    - Pause/Resume
    - Speed up/slow down
- Graphs to visualize data
    - Should be able to plot any gene/property of creatures
- Stretch goals:
    - Save/Load simulation state
